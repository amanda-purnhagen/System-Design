# System-Design
Demonstrates my ability to take the role of a systems analyst and create system design documents and business requirement documents for a hypothetical company, DriverPass. The DriverPass system provides students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests.

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
Our small consulting company has entered a contract with the DriverPass project team to create their new system. This system will provide eligible U.S. citizens with a learning hub for preparing for the drivers license exam. The system will offer students online practice exams, the ability to schedule appointments with experienced trainers in a DriverPass car, and much more.

## What did you do particularly well?
In this project, I believe I excelled at creating the System Design Document. The diagrams included in this document are appropriately exhaustive for their scope yet simple and concise. They are easy to read and comprehend. The technical requirements could be far more detailed, however. Overall, the document may not be a perfect interpretation of this theoretical system. However, I believe it is a very strong starting point as a first iteration.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise something in these documents, it would be the overall level of detail and specifics in the documents for the DriverPass project overall. Also, I understand that the scope of the project did not include actually implementing the DriverPass system design. However, there is always room for improvement, and beginning to create the system would be the only true way to find any shortcomings or mistakes and thus create a superior second iteration.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
While working on a system design, it is crucial to keep the users' needs in mind throughout every step of the process. The user provides the "why" of the entire project. The DriverPass system is being created for the sole purpose of providing the user with the tools they need to exceed expectations in the United States driver's license exam. Every aspect of analysis and design revolved around how to improve this demographic's user experience.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software, the most important step is to determine the scope of the project. Doing this will help you focus on what needs to be accomplished to make the system a reality. Then it is a matter of using your organization's preferred processes and methodologies to get the job done in a structured, organized, and streamlined manner. When I will analyze and design future systems, I will constantly keep the scope and "why" in mind in order to visualize the bigger picture while simultaneously decomposing work into lists of smaller tasks to avoid getting overwhelmed.
